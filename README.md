# qml-drops

This repository is deprecated, but you can still build the QML bindings!  Just visit the repository for the [drops library](https://github.com/edgenet/drops), where [the QML bindings](https://github.com/edgenet/drops/tree/master/bindings/qml) have been integrated with the automatic code generation process for the project.

If you have existing code using the qml-drops library, please note that you will have to change the import URI from:
```qml
import org.edgenet.drops 1.0
```
to:
```qml
import QmlDrops 1.0
```

This repository will be deleted soon.  Please refer all activity to: [https://github.com/edgenet/drops/tree/master/bindings/qml](https://github.com/edgenet/drops/tree/master/bindings/qml)
